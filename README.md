# simple_php_webhook

Welcome to `simple_php_webhook` ‚Äì the tool that's simple enough to set up and powerful enough to make you feel like a webhook wizard. This lightweight PHP-based webhook handler makes deploying changes via GitHub effortless for one or multiple projects.

## üöÄ Quick Setup Guide

1. **Clone the Repo**: First things first, clone this repo to your server.

2. **Configure**: We provide a configuration template (`config.json-template`). You'll need to make a copy of it and name it `config.json` in the main directory:
   ```sh
   cp config.json-template config.json
   ```
   Edit `config.json` to suit your needs. We'll walk through each setting below.

3. **Set up the Webhook Endpoint**:
   - Ensure that the `public` directory is accessible by your web server and the public internet. This is where GitHub will send those sweet, sweet webhook payloads.
   - The **main directory** should **not** be directly accessible via the web. It contains sensitive configuration details (like your `secret` key) and you wouldn't want the internet to see that, right?

4. **Point GitHub Webhook Here**: Set up a webhook in your GitHub repository to point to your server's publicly accessible URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/public/webhook_handler.php`). Don't forget to use the same `secret` key configured in `config.json`.

## üîß Configuration Values Explained

The configuration file (`config.json`) contains a few key settings that are critical to `simple_php_webhook`'s operation:

- **`secret`**: This is the shared secret key that must match between GitHub and this script. It's what keeps the bad guys out.

- **`log_file`**: The path to your log file where operational details get logged. Successes, failures, everything. Make sure the directory has the correct permissions for writing.

- **`projects`**: This is an array of projects, each with their own configuration:
  - **`github_repository`**: The GitHub repository name (e.g., `<Username>/<Project_name>`).
  - **`github_branch`**: The branch name you want to handle webhook requests for (`master`, etc.). Only requests from this branch will be processed.
  - **`project_path`**: The local path to the directory where the `git pull` command will be executed. This is where your code lives.

## üìù Example Configuration

Here's a quick example of what `config.json` might look like:

```json
{
    "secret": "your_secret_token_here",
    "log_file": "logs/webhook_log.txt",
    "projects": [
        {
            "github_repository": "your_username/your_project",
            "github_branch": "main",
            "project_path": "/var/www/html/your_project"
        }
    ]
}
```

## üåç Deploying on WebSupport.sk

Personally, I use this project on hosting platforms like **WebSupport.sk**. If you're deploying there and need any help getting things set up, feel free to reach out ‚Äì I'll be more than happy to help out.

Just keep in mind that the main directory must be kept safe, so it shouldn't be accessible directly from the internet. Only expose the `public` directory.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

This script is super simple, and that's its charm. But with great simplicity comes great responsibility. Make sure your `secret` is truly secret and that your server permissions are configured correctly. Otherwise, you might find yourself in a pickle when someone triggers an unintended `git pull`.
